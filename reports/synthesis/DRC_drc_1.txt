2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-2#1 Error
UNDEFINED I/O Standard issue  
872 out of 872 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'UNDEFINED' or 'DIFF_UNDEFINED', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. NOTE: This DRC is READONLY and cannot be waived. Problem ports: debug_out[7:0], m_axi_araddr[31:0], m_axi_arlen[7:0], m_axi_awaddr[31:0],
m_axi_awlen[7:0], m_axi_wdata[7:0], m_axis_output_tdata[23:0],
processed_data[7:0], s_axi_araddr[1], s_axi_araddr[2], s_axi_araddr[3],
s_axi_araddr[4], s_axi_araddr[5], s_axi_araddr[6], s_axi_araddr[7]
 (the first 15 of 63 listed).
Related violations: <none>

PS_WIZARD-1#1 Error
PS_WIZARD exists check - place design  
This design must contain a PS_WIZARD IP in the netlist hierarchy to function properly. Run opt_design to execute the PS_WIZARD or create an instance of the PS_WIZARD IP and configure it. Without a PS_WIZARD IP in the design, Vivado will not generate a CDO for the PMC, an elf for the PLM.
Related violations: <none>

PS_WIZARD-2#1 Error
PS_WIZARD exists check - wdi  
This design must contain a PS_WIZARD IP in the netlist hierarchy to function properly. Please create an instance of the PS_WIZARD IP and configure it. Without a PS_WIZARD IP in the design, Vivado will not generate a CDO for the PMC, an elf for the PLM.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-12#1 Error
No Routing  
The design is completely unrouted. Please run tcl command route_design.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Error
Unconstrained Logical Port  
872 out of 872 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: debug_out[7:0], m_axi_araddr[31:0], m_axi_arlen[7:0], m_axi_awaddr[31:0],
m_axi_awlen[7:0], m_axi_wdata[7:0], m_axis_output_tdata[23:0],
processed_data[7:0], s_axi_araddr[1], s_axi_araddr[2], s_axi_araddr[3],
s_axi_araddr[4], s_axi_araddr[5], s_axi_araddr[6], s_axi_araddr[7]
 (the first 15 of 63 listed).
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-3#1 Warning
Undefined I/O Standard alert  
872 out of 872 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'UNDEFINED' or 'DIFF_UNDEFINED', instead of a user assigned specific value.
